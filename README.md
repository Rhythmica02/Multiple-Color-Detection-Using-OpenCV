# Multiple-Color-Detection-Using-OpenCV
This project demonstrates a real-time multiple color detection application using OpenCV and Python. The program captures video from the webcam and identifies objects of red, green, and blue colors in the video stream. The detected colors are highlighted with bounding rectangles and labeled accordingly.
